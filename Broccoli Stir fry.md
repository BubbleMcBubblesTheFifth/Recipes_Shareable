### Ingredients

#### For the Sauce:

- ⅓ cup water
- ¼ cup low sodium soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 3 cloves garlic minced
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch
- crushed red pepper flakes to taste, optional for added spice
#### For the Stir Fry:

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 pound broccoli chopped into bite-sized florets
- 8 ounces cremini mushrooms sliced
- 1 bell pepper red, yellow or orange, sliced
- cooked white or brown rice for serving
- sesame seeds optional, for serving
### Instructions

- Combine all stir fry sauce ingredients in a small bowl: water, soy sauce, honey, garlic, ginger, black pepper, cornstarch and red pepper flakes (if using). Whisk to mix. Set aside.
- Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the broccoli and mushrooms and cook, stirring often, for 4 minutes. If you find that the pan is getting too hot on medium-high, turn the heat down to medium.
- Add the bell pepper and continue cooking, stirring often, for 2-3 minutes, until vegetables are crisp-tender.
- Whisk the sauce again to recombine the ingredients. Pour the sauce into the pan and cook, stirring, for 1 minute, until the sauce thickens.
- Serve over cooked rice, garnished with sesame seeds if desired.

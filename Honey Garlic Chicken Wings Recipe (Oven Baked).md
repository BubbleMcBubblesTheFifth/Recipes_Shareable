### Ingredients

- 50 chicken wings
- ¼ cup [all-purpose flour](https://amzlink.to/az0KleE9x5g2h)
- salt and black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon [olive oil](https://amzlink.to/az023FSrncaoQ)
- 1 tsp Garlic powder
- 1 tsp onion powder
- 1 tsp baking powder

#### Sauce

- 3/4 cup honey
- 1/2 cup water
- 6 tablespoons soy sauce
- 6 cloves garlic minced
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
- 1.5 teaspoon cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes

### Instructions

- Preheat oven to 425°F. Dab wings with paper towels until completely dry.
- Toss wings with flour, salt and pepper. Remove any excess flour and brush with olive oil (or use an olive oil spray).
- Line a pan with foil and then place parchment paper on top (you may need 2 pans) and bake for 35 minutes, turning at 20 minutes.
- Meanwhile, combine sauce ingredients in a small pan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer about 10 minutes or until slightly thickened and sauce coats the back of a spoon.
- Take wings from oven, toss with sauce and return to the oven for 10 minutes, turning after 5 minutes.
- Allow to cool 10 minutes. As the sauce cools, it thickens. Stir the wings every few minutes to coat in the sauce as it thickens.
### Notes
Store leftover wings in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. 
Reheat in the oven or in the air fryer until heated through.

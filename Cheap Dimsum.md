# Ingredients
## shrimp filling
200g shrimp (weight peeled)
0.5 tsp salt
1 tsp sugar
0.3 tsp pepper
1 tbsp white wine
0.5 tsp water
1 tbsp potato starch
1 tbsp cooking oil
0.5 tsp sesame oil

## dimsum sauce
2 tbsp soy sauce
2 tbsp sriracha sauce
2 tbsp honey 
# Directions
1. Cut half the shrimp into small 1/2 inch pieces. 
2. Cut the other half of shrimp the same, but bash them with the flat of the knife as well. 
3. Combine the shrimp pieces, salt, sugar, and pepper into a bowl. Mix in one direction for 2 minutes. 
4. Add white wine and water to mixture. Stir in one direction for 1 minute. 
5. Add potato starch. Stir in same direction for 2 minute. 
6. Add in cooking oil and sesame oil. Stir in same direction for 1 minute. 
7. Cover and place in fridge for at least 30 minutes or overnight. 
8. Start a steamer (electric or stovetop is fine). 
9. Soak rice paper and place a cubic inch worth of the shrimp mixture in the middle of the rice paper. Leaving 2 inches worth of space between fillings, repeat along the middle line of rice paper. 
10. Wrap up the rice paper by taking the bottom, folding it around the mid-section of the filling. Roll it towards the top, creasing the gap between the filling. 
11. Place the roll on a parchment paper and repeat until you're out of shrimp filling. 
12. Place parchment paper with rolls into steamer and steam for 5 minutes. 
13. While dimsum is cooking, make the sauce by mixing the sriracha, honey, and soy sauce together in a flat container. 
14. When dimsum is done steaming, remove from heat and cut the gaps in between the filling, placing each into the sauce dish. 
15. Wait until cooled and serve.
